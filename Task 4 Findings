While testing vcheck4 with different formulas,
both valid and not valid I found that for certain small formulas like,
(A1->A2)->(~A1vA2) the brute force method was faster then the minisat but as the complexity grew,
or more importantly as the amount of variables increased,
the brute force method became exponentially slower compared to the minisat.
